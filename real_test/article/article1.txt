The Chinese government's carefully constructed narrative around its Xinjiang detention centers appears to have been shattered by hundreds of pages of leaked documents published by Western media over the last two weeks.

Beijing has long insisted that its vast camps are voluntary "vocational training centers," where people learn job skills and are then free to leave.
Yet the leaks paint a grim picture of heavily fortified re-education centers, designed to turn Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities into good Chinese citizens who also speak Mandarin.
And the students can't leave until they have become just that.
There has been nothing yet to indicate the documents are fake -- both the New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists have published the original versions or verbatim copies on their websites. Even China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not directly disputed their authenticity.
"For all its efforts at secrecy, the Chinese government can no longer hide the extent, and the reach, of its campaign of repression in Xinjiang," regional expert Adrian Zenz wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times this week.
